### Review
Everything looks good and works well. I would suggest changing the text color in some areas, the white text on the almost white backgrounds made it very hard to read. I would also suggest making the way to change to shiny form a bit more obvious, I though that feture was not there until I checked the code. Great job all around its very clean.
